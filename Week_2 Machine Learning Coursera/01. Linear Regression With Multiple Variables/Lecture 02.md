Question
--------

When there are n features, we define the cost function as  
J((theta))=(1/2m)*(sum over i=1 to m(((h(theta)(x(i))) - y(i))^2))  
For linear regression, which of the following are also equivalent and correct definitions of J(theta)?  

### Answer

J((theta))=(1/2m)*(sum over i=1 to m(((theta)Tranpose *(x(i)) - y(i))^2))  
J((theta))=(1/2m)*(sum over i=1 to m(((sum over j=0 to n((theta(j)) *(x(i)(j))) - y(i))^2))
