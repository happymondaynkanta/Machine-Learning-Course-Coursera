Question
--------

Suppose a friend ran gradient descent three times, with (alpha)=0.01, (alpha)=0.1, and (alpha)=1, and got the following three plots (labeled A, B, and C):

Which plots corresponds to which values of (alpha)?  

### Answer

A is (alpha)=0.1, B is (alpha)=0.01, C is (alpha)=1

### Explanation

In A, value of (alpha) is reasonably alright. In B, value of (alpha) is very small so J(theta) converges slowly and in C, value of (alpha) is large enough for J(theta) to diverge.
