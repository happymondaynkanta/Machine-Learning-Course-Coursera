Question 1
----------

Suppose (theta)0=1,(theta)1=2, and we simultaneously update (theta)0 and (theta)1 using the rule:  
(theta)j := (theta)j+sqrt((theta)0*(theta)1) (for j = 0 and j=1)
What are the resulting values of (theta)0 and (theta)1?

### Answer

(theta)0 = 1+sqrt(2), (theta)1 = 2+sqrt(2)
